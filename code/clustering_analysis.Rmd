We suspect that the software mentions in a paper cluster together.  This would be useful to know because then we could do content analysis more quickly (because we wouldn't need to read as much of the paper in order to code mentions). We could use a "whitelist" of known package names to identify the "mention rich" parts of the papers, then code that.  But first we need to know what we might miss by making that change.

Procedure:

1. Generate a whitelist of known package names as "seeds".
2. Search the full text of the papers to find those names.
3. Use a window around those seeds as "what we would have coded with this new technique"
4. Ask: What proportion of mentions would have been included in the window? Call that recall.
5. Repeat for many possible random samples of seeds (and take the average).

Repeat that for varying window sizes.

Eventually we should get a curve showing the relationship between window size and recall.
